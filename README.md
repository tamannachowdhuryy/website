**Personal Website**

Hi, my name is Tamanna Chowdhury, and this is my personal website. On this website, I showcase the projects I've completed during my college career and my internship experiences.

**About Me**
I am studying Computer Science at Hunter College as a Daedalus Scholar and am currently a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI 127). Recently, I completed an internship with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), where I developed a Python program to process and organize extensive banking information. This program serves as a crosswalking tool, aiding approximately 100 teams in efficiently managing and analyzing data. My experience at the FDIC has honed my programming skills and deepened my understanding of data management and analysis in the financial sector.

I aspire to become a software engineer by the time I graduate in May 2025. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with the skills and determination to achieve this goal.
